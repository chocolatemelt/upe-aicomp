1) Placing portal

2) Farming Phase

evaluation should be based on how close the soft block is / how rewarding it
is to break the soft block

*more rewarding to work on soft blocks that are concentrated in an area*




gather enough coins for one of each power-up
prioritize bomb pierce

after each power-up has been bought once, enter kill-phase

====

general algorithm:
 drop bomb
 get out of the way
 get coins
 rinse/repeat


 *only drop a bomb if we can get out of its way*
 *work towards the center*


TO-DO:

    make function that sees if route is possible.
    generally work towards the opponent

====

3) Kill Phase

(could be triggered by opponent being in a certain distance/
based on a "lethal_range" calc. from our power-ups)

calculate the general range of where opponent can move
trap opponent using bomb/soft_block into a range that is linear


====


*AVOID TRAIL MAP AT ALL COSTS*
*Always check if we have enough coins for power-up*

*when AI is waiting for bomb to tick, buy purchases if possible*



function that returns all the possible coordinates that we can walk to
function that returns all the coordinates that would be burned by a bomb if placed where we're standing

priotize getting to safety rather than getting more coins

prioritize pierce / congested softblock areas / center blocks

if we're going to do nothing, should try and buy power-up
